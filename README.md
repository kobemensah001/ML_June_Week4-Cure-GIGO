Assignment 4.1: Cure GIGO

 In the real world, a machine learning practitioner spends 80% of the time with cleaning data and extracting features from it. These steps may preclude all other steps. Thus in this assignment we practice how to perform feature engineering and observe its impact on model performance.
 
Apply three or more feature engineering techniques on the credit-default data and, 

•	Demonstrate the effectiveness of your techniques by rebuilding the decision tree and GBT to achieve 20% or better performance improvement for the evaluation criteria you chose (note - accuracy is NOT a good choice here).

•	Justify your choice of feature engineering techniques that you used.

      •	Sampling approaches or adjustments to the weighting of the target variable will count towards feature engineering
